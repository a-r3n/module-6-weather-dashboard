# module-6-weather-dashboard
A dashboard to look up the weather anywhere in the world

## Description

Users can search any city in the world and see the weather forecast for the next 5 days. It displays:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Overall weather conditions

The search functionality saves previous searches so users can click back and see any city they previously searched.

## Usage

Users can enter their chosen city in the search bar at the top left of the screen. When they click 'Search' the weather forecast will display.
